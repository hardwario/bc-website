Software Development Kit or **SDK** is a package of software libraries that simplifies programming of BigClown hardware. This libraries contains functions to easily create your application skeleton and for easy communication with the hardware.

BigClown SDK has clean design and unified access to the hardware, sensors and peripherals. The complete package is tested together and therefore you wouldn't have software or peripheral resources conflicts.
