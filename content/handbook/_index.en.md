perex: <p>Get ahead of the game. <strong>BigClown</strong> is an entertaining device that will help you understand and create the <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (IoT). It means that everything around you, even your chair, can become a smart device <strong>connected with your computer or mobile phone</strong>. Thanks to this connection, you can start to improve your home, classroom or even the entire city and the world in a digital way.</p><p>The <strong>Starter Kit</strong> is the fundamental kit to get you started, however, you can later upgrade it with our extensive range of kits. See how you can build your first smart device and how to create projects that will amaze your friends, family and us as well. 👌</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert the <strong>batteries</strong> onto the yellow plate (Mini Battery Module).</li>
<li>Then take the <strong>red plate</strong> (Core Module). On one of its sides, it has two parallel panels with holes. Push the <strong>black plate</strong> pins (Button Module) into these holes. That way you put both modules together. 👍</li>
<li><strong>The yellow plate</strong> has <strong>two sets of small round holes</strong> on one side. Insert the <strong>the red plate pins</strong> into them.<br/>
❗<strong>Attention</strong>: Batteries face downwards, away from the red plate.</li>
<li>Encase everything in the <strong>cover</strong> and secure it with <strong>rubber bands</strong>.</li>
<li>The last thing to do is to put together the <strong>USB Dongle</strong>. Enclose the chip in the black box so the silver connector sticks out. </li>

<p>With the Starter Kit, you can <strong>measure the ambient temperature</strong>. 🌡This can be used, for example, when measuring the temperature of your room or as a preventive fire detector in the kitchen.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Connect the USB Dongle with the box and the computer <strong>as described above</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Messages</strong> tab in the application. You will automatically see the room temperature changing. Measurements occur periodically or when there is a big change. To speed it up, you can hold the box in your hands and <strong>blow on it</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Our tip:</strong> Put the box in the fridge for a while and watch the temperature changing.</p>

<p>Starter Kit can sense the position. It will register the change whenever you turn it over. You can use it as a detector that something has fallen or somebody got up from bed. 🖖</p>

<li>Connect the USB Dongle with the box and the computer <strong>as described above</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Messages</strong> tab in the Playground app.</li>
<li><strong>Turn the box to the other side.</strong> You will see on the screen that the position has changed.</li>
<li>Each position has a number code. Find out <strong>what the code means for each position</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Our tip:</strong> Use the box as a smart throwing cube. Maybe for the game, Ludo.</p>

<p>Now you will finally find out what the big button is for. 🤔 For example, you can use it for counting.</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the USB Dongle with the box and the computers as <strong>described above</strong>.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Messages</strong> tab in the Playground app.</li>
<li><strong>Push the button on the box</strong>. This action will be displayed in the app.</li>
<li>The button <strong>counts how many times you pushed it</strong>.</li>

<p><strong>Our tip:</strong> In advanced projects you will learn even more interesting features. For example, how to turn the button into a doorbell which will send the message into your mobile everytime someone uses it. 👌</p>
