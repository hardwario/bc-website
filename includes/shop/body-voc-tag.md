VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) sensor is a great technology for indoor air quality measurement applications. Elevated VOC levels can have a negative impact on well being, comfort, and cognitive abilities. Typacal VOC sources are cosmetics, detergents containing alcohols or aldehydes, carpets and flooring, paints, human and animal occupants. Measuring Total VOC (TVOC) level can helps to increase the efficiency of ventilation and air purification, and increases awareness of VOC sources and indoor air pollution.

| Level        | TVOC (ppb)  | Hygienic Rating          | Recommendation                                                   | Exposure Limit |
|--------------|-------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 5 - Unhealty | 2200 - 5500 | Situation not acceptable | Use only if unavoidable / Intense ventilation necessary          | hours          |
| 4 - Poor     | 660 - 2200  | Major objections         | Intensified ventilation / airing necessary, search for sources   | < 1 month      |
| 3 - Moderate | 220 - 660   | Some objections          | Intensified ventilation / airing recommended, search for sources | < 12 months    |
| 4 - Good     | 65 - 220    | No relevant objections   | Ventilation / airing recommended                                 | no limit       |
| 5 - Excelent | 0 - 660     | No objections            | Target value                                                     | no limit       |
