The **Humidity Tag** uses a high-accuracy **humidity sensor** SHT20 with a typical accuracy of ±3 % from 20 % to 80 %. This sensor is digital and calibrated. It communicates using an I²C bus and features a very low power operation and shutdown mode.

Relative humidity is the essential attribute of the environment we live in. The recommended indoor range is between 30 % and 60 %.

**Values below this range (dry air) can lead to various health issues. On the other hand, the values above this range may result in troubles with moisture.**
