### <span style="color: #ff0000;">IMPORTANT NOTE:</span>

For any wireless project, you will need our radio gateway. It can be any **Core Module** with Micro USB cable, or the **USB Dongle** (recommended). We also recommend using a single-board computer **Raspberry Pi 3** as a hub instead of your computer.
