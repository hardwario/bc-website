The **Barometer Tag** allows you to measure absolute pressure in the range from 20 kPa to 110 kPa, or altitude above the sea level in meters. It uses a low-power I²C sensor MPL3115A2 with an absolute accuracy of ±0.4 kPa. It features a very low active and standby current.

Monitoring of absolute pressure is useful for weather forecast and it is also an important parameter in biometeorology because the absolute pressure can affect our health.
