To make the USB Dongle get along with the Core module, you have to pair the Dongle with the box. They will go wild together. 💘

Pairing is important so that the Dongle **only communicates with your box** and no other. So if there are more devices that you share in your classroom or with friends, pair the Dongle with the box **each time**.

## Pair the Dongle with the Core module

1.  If you haven’t put together your kit yet, go for it now. If you have the Starter Kit, [here you will find instructions to put it together]({{< ref "/handbook/_index.en.md" >}}). Connect the completed USB Dongle to your computer.

2. In the Playground, open the **Devices** tab. Select **USB dongle** in the toolbar.

3. Click on **Connect** and it will connect you to the Dongle.

4.  Now is the time to pair it with the kit. **Disconnect the batteries** in the box first.
5. In the Playground, click on **Start pairing** in the Devices tab to have Dongle to pick up the signal.

6. Then **connect the batteries** again. A red diode flashes wildly under the hood of USB Dongle to tell you that both devices are pairing. 🚨

7. The pairing is complete in a second. In the Playground, click on **Stop pairing**, so you don’t pick up your friend’s device. **And it’s done!** 💪

### 🙌 You got it right, if:

* each action appears in the Playground. Click on the **Messages** tab and press the button (or perform another action for which you have set the device). You should receive a confirmation message.
